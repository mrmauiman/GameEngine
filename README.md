This is a game engine created by Maui Kelley for the game development course at Roanoke College.

Note for Dr. Bouchard:
  I created a Material class to handle materials so please use my makefile while
  testing or add it to your makefile and make sure model.o needs material.o.

  I also have a helper and constants file.
